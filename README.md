<h1>NixOS Dotfiles</h1>
</div>

This repo contains configuration for my computers, 1 desktop
(`bundesk`) and 1 laptop (`pawpad`). I am no doubt doing something, somewhere, wrong.

- **Window Manager**: [Hyprland](https://hyprland.org)
- **Shell**: [Fish](https://fishshell.com)
- **Terminal Emulator**: [Kitty](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty)
- **Panel**: [Waybar](https://github.com/Alexays/Waybar)
- **Notifications**: [Dunst](https://github.com/dunst-project/dunst)
- **File Manager**: [Ranger](https://github.com/ranger/ranger) and [Nautilus](https://apps.gnome.org/Nautilus/)

I'm using [Stylix](https://github.com/danth/stylix) to theme everything, meaning I can switch themes in one place and have everything follow!

### Inspiration

There are no doubt too many sources to list! However, here are a few:

- The whole structure of my dots is _heavily_ based on [notashelf's](https://github.com/NotAShelf/nyx). Many comments and sections of code have been directly copied from that config.
- [LibrePhoenix](https://www.youtube.com/@librephoenix/videos)
- My neovim config is heavily inspired by [Neve](https://github.com/redyf/Neve)
- Soooo many people on [r/unixporn](https://reddit.com/r/unixporn)!
