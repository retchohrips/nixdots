<h1>NixOS Dotfiles</h1>
</div>

This repo contains configuration for my computers, 1 desktop
(`bundesk`) and 1 laptop (`pawpad`). I am no doubt doing something, somewhere, wrong.

### Inspiration

There are too many sources to list! However, here are a few:

- The whole structure of my dots is _heavily_ based on [notashelf's](https://github.com/NotAShelf/nyx). Many comments and sections of code have been directly copied from that config.
- [LibrePhoenix](https://www.youtube.com/@librephoenix/videos)
- My neovim config is heavily inspired by [Neve](https://github.com/redyf/Neve)
- Soooo many people on [r/unixporn](https://reddit.com/r/unixporn)!
